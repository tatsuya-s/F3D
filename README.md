# F3D - Fast and minimalist 3D viewer

By [Kitware SAS](https://www.kitware.eu), 2019

F3D (pronounced `/fÉ›d/`) is a [VTK-based](https://vtk.org) 3D viewer following the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), so it is minimalist, efficient, has no GUI, has simple interaction mechanisms and is fully controllable using arguments in the command line.

It is open-source and cross-platform (tested on Windows, Linux, and macOS).
It supports a range of file formats, rendering and texturing options.

# Installation

You can find the release binary packages for Windows, Linux, and OSX on the [Release page](https://gitlab.kitware.com/f3d/f3d/-/releases).
Alternatively, you can build it yourself, following the [build guide](#build).

# How to use

There is mainly three ways to use F3D.

 * By running F3D from a terminal with command-line options.
 * By running F3D directly and then using drag&drop files into it to open them.
 * By using F3D as an "Open with" program with specific file types.

# Build

## Dependencies
* [CMake](https://cmake.org) >= 3.1 .
* [VTK](https://vtk.org) >= 9.0.0 (optionally with raytracing capabilities to enable OSPray rendering).
* A C++11 compiler.
* A CMake-compatible build system (Visual Studio, XCode, Ninja, Make...).

## Configuration and building
Set the following CMake options:
* `VTK_DIR`: Point to a build or install directory of VTK.
* `BUILD_TESTING`: Optionally, enable the tests.
* `MACOSX_BUILD_BUNDLE`: On macOS, build a `.app` bundle.
* `WINDOWS_BUILD_WIN32`: On Windows, build a Win32 application (without console).

Then build the software using your build system.

# File formats

Here is the list of supported file formats:
* **.vtk** : the legacy VTK format
* **.vt[p|u|r|i|s|m]** : XML based VTK formats
* **.ply** : Polygon File format
* **.stl** : Standard Triangle Language format
* **.dcm** : DICOM file format
* **.nrrd/.nhrd** : "nearly raw raster data" file format
* **.mhd/.mha** : MetaHeader MetaIO file format
* **.ex2/.e/.exo/.g** : Exodus 2 file format
* **.gml** : CityGML file format
* **.pts** : Point Cloud file format
* **.obj** : Wavefront OBJ file format (full scene)
* **.gltf/.glb** : GL Transmission Format (full scene)
* **.3ds** : Autodesk 3DS Max file format (full scene)
* **.wrl** : VRML file format (full scene)

# Scene construction

The **full scene** formats (gltf/glb, 3ds, wrl, obj) contain not only *geometry*, but also scene information like *lights*, *cameras*, *actors* in the scene and *textures* properties.
By default, all this information will be loaded from the file and displayed.
For file formats that do not support it, **a default scene** will be provided.

# Rendering precedence
Some rendering options are not compatible between them, here is the precedence order if several are defined:
- Raytracing (`-r`)
- Volume (`-v`)
- Point Sprites (`-o`)

# Interaction

Simple interaction with the displayed data is possible directly within the window. It is as follows:
* *Click and drag* with the *left* mouse button to rotate around the focal point of the camera.
* Hold *Shift* then *Click and drag* horizontally with the *right* mouse button to rotate the HDRI.
* *Click and drag* vertically with the *right* mouse button to zoom in/out.
* *Move the mouse wheel* to zoom in/out.
* *Click and drag* with the *middle* mouse button to translate the camera.
* Drag and Drop a file or directory into the F3D window to load it

Some options can be toggled directly using interactions:
* Press `S` key to toggle the coloration by scalar.
* Press `B` key to toggle the display of the scalar bar, only when coloring with scalars.
* Press `P` key to toggle depth peeling.
* Press `Q` key to toggle Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion.
* Press `A` key to toggle Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing.
* Press `T` key to toggle tone mapping.
* Press `E` key to toggle the display of cell edges.
* Press `X` key to toggle the trihedral axes display.
* Press `G` key to toggle the XZ grid display.
* Press `N` key to toggle the display of the file name.
* Press `M` key to toggle the display of the metadata if exists.
* Press `Z` key to toggle the display of the FPS counter.
* Press `R` key to toggle raytracing.
* Press `D` key to toggle the denoiser when raytracing.
* Press `V` key to toggle volume rendering.
* Press `I` key to toggle opacity function inversion during volume rendering.
* Press `O` key to toggle point sprites rendering.
* Press `F` key to toggle full screen.
* Press `U` key to toggle background blur.

Other interactions are available:
* Press `H` key to toggle the display of a cheat sheet showing all these hotkeys and their statuses.
* Press `?` key to dump camera state to the terminal.
* Press `ESC` key to close the window and quit F3D.
* Press `ENTER` key to reset the camera to its inital parameters.
* Press `LEFT` to load the previous file if any
* Press `RIGHT` to load the next file if any
* Press `UP` to reload the current file

# Configuration file

All the command-line options can be controlled using a configuration file.
This configuration file uses the "long" version of the options in a JSON
formatted file to provide default values for these options.

These options can be organized by block using a regular expression for each block
in order to provide different default values for the different filetypes.

Using a command-line option will override the corresponding value in the config file.
A typical config file may look like this :

```javascript
{
   ".*": {
       "resolution": "1200,800",
       "bg-color": "0.7,0.7,0.7",
       "color": "0.5,0.1,0.1",
       "fxaa": true,
       "timer": true,
       "progress": true,
       "axis": true,
       "bar": true,
       "verbose": true,
       "roughness": 0.2,
       "grid": true
   },
   ".*vt.": {
       "edges": true
   },
   ".*gl(tf|b)": {
       "raytracing": true,
       "denoise": true,
       "samples": 3
   },
   ".*mhd": {
       "volume": true
   }
}
```
This first block defines a basic configuration with many desired options for all files.
The second block specifies that all files ending with vt., eg: vtk, vtp, vtu, ... will be shown with edges on.
The third block specifies raytracing usage for .gltf and .glb files.
The last block specifies that volume rendering should be used with .mhd files.

The configuration file possible locations depends on your operating system.
They are considered in the below order and only the first found will be used.
 * Linux : `/etc/f3d/config.json`, `[install_dir]/config.json`, `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/.config/f3d/config.json`, `~/.config/f3d/config.json`
 * Windows : `[install_dir]\config.json`, `%APPDATA%\f3d\config.json`
 * MacOS : `/etc/f3d/config.json`, `f3d.app/Contents/Resources/config.json`, `[install_dir]/config.json`, `~/.config/f3d/config.json`

If you are using our release, a default configuration file will be installed when installing F3D.
On Linux, it will be installed in /etc/f3d/, on Windows, it will be installed in the install directory, on MacOS, it will be installed in the bundle.

# Limitations

* No support for animation.
* No support for specifying manual lighting in the default scene.
* Drag&Drop does not work with Thunar file manager.
* Pressing the `z` hotkey to display the FPS timer triggers a double render.
* Volume rendering is only available for 3D image data
* Multiblock (.vtm, .gml) support is partial, non-surfacic data will be converted into surfaces.

# Troubleshootings

## General
> I have built F3D with raytracing support but the denoiser is not working.

Be sure that VTK has been built with *OpenImageDenoise* support (`VTKOSPRAY_ENABLE_DENOISER` option).

## Windows
> I use F3D in a VM, the application fails to launch

OpenGL applications like F3D can have issues when launched from a guest Windows because the access to the GPU is restricted.\
You can try to use a software implementation of OpenGL, called [Mesa](https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/releases).
 * Download the lastest `release-msvc`
 * copy `x64/OpenGL32.dll` and `x64/libglapi.dll` in the same folder as `f3d.exe`.
 * set the environment variable `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE` to 4.5
 * run `f3d.exe`
